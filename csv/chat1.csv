That’s all you need to spout

Exactly who to ask and how?

Just use my vid to find out

To claim the precious trout

Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen

With the possibility the world is packed

But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max

And that’s beyond a fact

Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice

Post on TikTok videos?

I watched that youtube video about cryptic clues, and thus tried on the ""world is packed"" line following the same logic.

""with the possibility, the world is packed""
I looked up possibility in cryptic clues, it said that ""fling"" is often the answer
then the world is also the ""earth""
and then if you pack world with fling you get earthling

the next line, the keeper of the secret is not close to max, made me think that this just confirms it, who's further away than an astronaut?

Did you have any idea about the crossword possibilities
I think if it is as you say it might be only these 4 sentences that point to a ""Crossword"" 

""In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish""
That’s all you need to spout
Exactly who to ask and how?
Just use my vid to find out
To claim the precious trout


**Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen**

**With the possibility the world is packed**

**keeper of the secret is not close to Max
that’s beyond a fact**

**Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice
Post on TikTok videos?**


No need to spam or guess or stir things up

Thats all you need to spout. 
Exactly who to ask and how?
Just use my vid to find out
To claim the precious trout*

So I think this means that we have to enter this text somewhere on a website or sent an email.

Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen

With the possibility the world is packed

keeper of the secret is not close to Max
that’s beyond a fact

Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice
Post on TikTok videos?

I really think these 4 sentences are the key to the puzzle 
Does each of these 4 sentence point to a word? like in a crossword puzzle

or: 
The keeper of the secret is not close to max. 
Thats beyond the fact. 

what or who is not close to max ?

No need to spam or guess or stir things up

Just copy what this silly song shows

What does this mean? ""just copy what this silly song shows""
the words itself point to a faulty website most likely

but what does the silly song show? 

a guy standing in front of a piano holding a fish?
What is the silly song? is it the song he is singing in this video or does it refer to another song? found by a clue above?

So many questions QQ","",""

""Tens of thousands of letters from Masqueraders have convinced me that the human mind has an equal capacity for pattern-matching and self-deception. While some addicts were busy cooking the riddle, others were more single-mindedly continuing their own pursuit of the hare quite regardless of the news that it had been found. Their own theories had come to seem so convincing that no exterior evidence could refute them. These most determined of Masqueraders may grudgingly have accepted that a hare of some sort was dug up at Ampthill, but **they believed there would be another hare, or a better solution, awaiting them at their favourite spot**. Kit would expect them to continue undismayed by the much publicised diversion at Ampthill and would be looking forward to the day when he would greet them as the real discoverers of the real puzzle of Masquerade. Optimistic expeditions were still setting out, with shovels and maps, throughout the summer of 1982""","",""

"833086124384976907","JCMS#0557","07-Aug-22 05:00 PM","1:   ""In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish""
Remove the letters F,I,S,H from Maximillian Arthur Fosh and you are left with two anagrams. Natural and Maloroma and the spare X. This is common in old riddles to indicate a place ""X marks the spot"" Natural and Maloroma means ""a naturally smelly place"". The most natural smelly place on earth is Rotorua, New Zealand.
2:    That’s all you need to spout
The exact description for Rotorua, New Zealand is ""Rotorua was built on top of a geothermal hot spot, and there are numerous geysers"" This is what I think he means by Spout.
3:    Exactly who to ask and how?
Not a clue but an instruction
4:    Just use my vid to find out
Not a clue but an instruction
5:    To claim the precious trout
Not a clue but an instruction - No significance in Trout - it rhymes.
6:    Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen
This is definitely a reference to Guy Pearce. He was in Neighbors and played Priscilla Queen Of The Desert. He can be seen on top of a bus at 0:27 of this video hence Neighbor on the bus or dear old queen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2hXtde2x6c. Guy has New Zealand heritage via his father.
8:    But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max
I know - Its someone outside of England - Not Spain or New Zealand. This took me a while to figure out!
9:    And that’s beyond a fact
Information
10:   Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice
Instruction to claim - A certain kind of dance - this is hidden in the video
11:    Post on TikTok videos?
Instruction to claim - Post yourself dancing the special dance and tag the keeper of the secret.
No need to spam or guess or stir things up
Clue to who to tell

Next, we look at ""Use a squeaky voice"", where a squeaky voice = whine, and a homophone for whine is wine (as indicated be the word use). Finally, we have ""Post on TikTok videos?"". The question mark tells us it's a pun, and a pun for TikTok is tick tock, which could be referring to time. Therefore, if we assume that this is a double definition, we find the clue can be broken up into ""Post on time"" and ""Videos"". Now, think about this. If you are posting on time, that means you are streaming the videos from your PC to a server. And when watching videos, you have to stream them. We find the words are ""Drunk Wine Stream"".

That’s all you need to spout

To claim the prescious trout
Neighbor on the bus, a dear old queen

But the keeper of the secret is not close to max
And that’s beyond a fact
Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice
Post on tiktok videos?
No need to spam or guess or stir things up
Just copy what this silly song shows

That’s all you need to spout

Exactly who to ask and how?

Just use my vid to find out

To claim the precious trout

Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen

With the possibility the world is packed

But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max

And that’s beyond a fact

Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice

Post on TikTok videos?

No need to spam or guess or stir things up

OECD ""The student must evaluate the information carefully and then consider whether the statement is truly a fact or if it goes beyond a fact and reflects the opinion of the author. In this way, the student must consider the reliability of the statements, which is related to the cognitive subprocess of «Weighing sources».""

This quotation makes clear that ""beyond a fact"" may deal with the **interpretation of facts **and the consequent** formation of opinions.**

“proven beyond reasonable doubt” - the proof has surpassed the ability to be doubted

“he is beyond stupid” - he has surpassed stupid, he is extremely stupid

```“Max is a great YouTuber, not to mention a funny comedian, so his success is understandable”```

or 

```“Beyond *the* fact that Max is a great YouTuber, he is also a funny comedian, so his success is understandable.”```

All this stuff about horses has got me thinking... 

I remember a riddle that involved wordplay between the words 'horse' and 'hoarse' - specifically, to escape an isolated scenario, you had to shout until your voice was 'hoarse' so you could ride away on a resulting 'horse'.

Sound familiar? 'Dance in a crazy way, *use a squeaky voice*'.
Yes folks, it's definitely a horse we're looking for...","",""

“use my vid to find out” doesnt 100% imply max’s vid, after all the song also says “not close to max” which sorta implies that the song is from another persons pov.

now vid can also mean vehicle identification. if we view “use my vid to find out” as more of a use “my vid” to “find out” (to being ‘until’), and go back to the trout video where Jeds Vehicle plate is shown to be “tr1out”, and “find out” is said like 30 seconds later. What happens in between the time that his VID is shown and max says “find out”? 

Thats right, a clip from the incredibles where frozone says “HONEY WHERE IS MY SUPER SUIT”

this confirms that it must be samuel l jackson who is the keeper of the secret

He was also in something called ""gargoyle"" - aka keepers

And a film called ""Helen of Troy"" who was married to a king therefore being a ""dear old queen""
And he was born in Wiltshire, the next county along from where the last hunt resulted.

Almost certainly. But it was a nice wormhole to go down. I'd like a minor credit if this goes on to help the eventual winner. Thanks and goodbye.","","👍 (8)"

port, Gerald, as a matter of fact, Finchley told me it's exactly the same port your father gets from him.
Gerald: Then it'll be all right. The governor prides himself on being a good judge of port. I don’t pretend to 
know much about it.
Sheila: (gaily, possessively) I should jolly well think not, Gerald, I'd hate you to know all about port – like 
one of these purple-faced old men.

Sheila Birling: no, not yet. But then you don't know all about port – do you?
Birling: (noticing that his wife has not taken any) N ow then, Sybil, you must a take a little tonight. Special 
occasion, y'know, eh?
Sheila: Yes, go on, mummy. You must drink our health.
Mrs Birling : (smiling) Very well, then. Just a little, thank you.(to Edna, who is about to go, with tray.) all 
right, Edna. I'll ring from the drawing room when we want coffee. Probably in about half an hour.

Gerald: (politely) Absolutely first class.
Mrs Birling: (reproachfully) Arthur, you're not supposed to say such thingsBirling: Oh – come come – I’m treating Gerald like one of the family. And I'm sure he won't object.
Sheila: (with mocking aggressiveness) Go on, Gerald – just you object!
Gerald: (smiling) Wouldn't dream of it. In fact, I insist upon being one of the family now. I've been trying 
long enough, haven't I? (as she does not reply, with more insistence.) Haven't I? You know I have.
Mrs Birling: (smiling) Of course she does.
Sheila: (half serious, half playful) Yes – except for all last summer, when you never came near me, and I 
wondered what had happened to you.
Gerald: And I’ve told you – I was awfully busy at the works all that time.
Sheila: (same tone as before) Yes,that's what you say.
Mrs Birling: Now, Sheila, don't tease him. When you're married you'll realize that men with important 
work to do sometimes have to spend nearly all their time and energy on their business. You'll have to get used to 
that, just as I had.

Mrs Birling: Now stop it, you two. Arthur, what about this famous toast of yours?
Birling: Yes, of course. ( clears his throat.) well, Gerald, I know you agreed that we should only have this 
quiet little family party. It's a pity sir George and – we – lady croft can't be with us, but they're abroad and so it 
can't be helped. As I told you, they sent me a very nice cable – couldn't be nicer. I'm not sorry that we're celebrating 
quietly like thisMrs Birling: Much nicer really.
Gerald: I agree.
Birling: So do I, but it makes speech-making more difficultEric: (not too rudely) Well . Don't do any. We'll drink their health and have done with it.
Birling: No, we won't. It's one of the happiest nights of my life. And one day, I hope, Eric, when you've a 
daughter of your own, you'll understand why. Gerald, I’m going to tell you frankly, without any pretences, that 
your engagement to Sheila means a tremendous lot to me. She'll make you happy, and I’m sure you'll make her 
happy. You're just the kind of son-in-law I always wanted. Your father and I have been friendly rivals in business 
for some time now – though crofts limited are both older and bigger than Birling and company – and now you've 
brought us together, and perhaps we may look forward to the time when Crofts and Birlings are no longer 
competing but are working together – for lower costs and higher prices.
Gerald: Hear, hear! And I think my father would agree to that.

Marching on foot Roman road

But all throughout his posts he took golds

To stash nightly dugouts to own

A boy joins up without a job

How his loot has shown

To maintain in a hoard

Key is to go far from home

Above white rocks a seagull dives

Below the bush you squeeze

The morning fox is sniffing rabbits

Jumping on an east borne breeze

Burials twice as ancient

Lay under a nearby mound

The Roman's secret word was ""crimeking""

And his treasures not been found","",""

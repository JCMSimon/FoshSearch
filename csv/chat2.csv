And that‚Äôs beyond a fact

Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice

The particular stand he is using is a cheap geode with a pole in the middle, and the fish is simply balanced on top, since it needs to not be attached in any way to it at risk of lowering its value.

That being said as an artist I'm pretty familiar with this stand: there is NO WAY to control what angle the fish is point other than a general left and right, and even at that its not easy.

This laid out, I am pointing out a few things.
1. Before and after each cut his head is looking up as though he had been checking on the fish to make sure its okay.

2. After the first cut when the fish seemed to be spinning around a little towards the other direction, the cut is oddly timed between a word, and the fish is very clearly repositioned to face the same direction it was before, but he's holding it differently for more stability. This is a fix, he wants the fish to stay in that direction.

3. After the phrase ""beyond a fact"", the direction chances to the opposite facing way, and stays that way the rest of the song.

That is what we know about the fish direction. This is the only thing he controls about the fish position is the over all left-right direction it is facing.","","upvote (7)"

""Not close to Max"" is interesting and could mean a couple things:

1. Look at the two letters on either side of 'Max'.  OF MAX FO. 
 I find the symmetry here telling. 'F' is close to max, Is 'O' the keeper?

2. Extending the same thought to words instead of letters. NAME OF MAX FOSH DISH
 'OF' and 'FOSH' are close to max. Is the keeper the name of a dish? 

3. Another extension of the same thought, what are the furthest words from Max? 'IN' and 'FISH'
 Is there a clue in a fish? Or is this a spoonerism for FINISH / FINNISH?

**In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish. ** - Draw the fish out of Max Fosh(the name).
**Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen **- There is nothing here. These are possible ways(putting together and spoonerism) you can manipulate the fish out of the name and Max is telling us the different ways.....why they were so easy to solve.
**With the possibility the world is packed** - As already said, the World = Earth(maybe).......Earth being packed could refer to when dirt is packed. As in when you press down on the soil after you bury something.
**But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max** - I think this will be solved with Classic Crossword Cryptography. I believe solving ""In the name of Max Fosh"" will result in a dual meaning that is both the new answer and a actual type of synonym ""Keeper""..  So, The keeper of the secret is the Straight Part. And In the name of Max Fosh is the Cryptic. ORRRR The Keeper of the Secret is the Straight and, simply, ""is not close to Max"" the cryptic.

"761664600571379785","flyingdutchboy1#1415","05-Aug-22 06:35 PM","I've said this numerous times that it looks like a cryptic crossword

Like they mention neighbour on a bus could mean ""Seatmate"" it's a common croddword answer.
However neighbour can refer to two words going together.
On a bus can refer to ""Aboard""
Dear old queen can mean Victoria/Anne/Elizabeth or even ER.

The next line starts ""with"" which could suggest it goes with the line starting neighbour or it could refer to the specific line only

The first line could mean Aboard Victoria, which would reference getting in a ship","","👍 (1)"

Theme Setter Section/Instructions [
    “In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish”
    That’s all you need to spout
    Exactly who to ask and how?
    Just use my vid to find out
    To claim the precious trout
]

Actual Clue [
    Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen (It could be anyone)
    With the possibility the world is packed (The world is full, so no room for the keeper of the secret)
    But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max (The keeper of the secret is not packed/maximum)
    And that’s beyond a fact (Undoubtedly the truth)

        // The keeper of the secret is a cryptic meaning for a Website, as there’s no room in the world for the keeper and the internet is not close to maximum capacity. Therefore the keeper of the secret (where the fish/how to get it) is a Website.

    Dance in a crazy way,
    use a squeaky voice
    Post on TikTok videos?

         // This section here is the only part of the song that will solve what the website is.

Did you get to the answer with no guessing, by chance or anagrams? Or just by using the song [

"784825209407799297","RoGarf#7848","07-Aug-22 07:18 PM","Theory Numero 1: This is relating to ""With the possibility the world is packed"".
First, a synonym for The World is Earth.
Packed implies that there is a hidden word, which could be talking about Ear inside Earth.
Now, a synonym for The Possibility? Risk.
Adding the two words together, (implied by With) we get Risk+Ear.If Ear implies a Homophone, the answer is Riskier.

Theory Number 2: We start by looking at ""Dance in a crazy way"", which if we infer is an anagram indicator, we find that Dance is Caned (or essentially drunk). 
Next, we look at ""Use a squeaky voice"", where a squeaky voice = whine, and a homophone for whine is wine (as indicated be the word use). 
Finally, we have ""Post on TikTok videos?"". The question mark tells us it's a pun, and a pun for TikTok is tick tock, which could be referring to time. 
Therefore, if we assume that this is a double definition, we find the clue can be broken up into ""Post on time"" and ""Videos"". Now, think about this. 
If you are posting on time, that means you are streaming the videos from your PC to a server. 
And when watching videos, you have to stream them. 
We find the words are ""Drunk Wine Stream"". And who got drunk from a wine stream? 
I have no clue.

Theory Numero 3: The second section of the song is about who to ask, and the third is how.","",""

> Just use my vid to find out

> To claim the precious trout…

the world is packed… (could mean ‘whole world’)
> But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max… (not a relation/not physically close)
> And that’s beyond a fact (could mean: ‘the keeper of the secret’ is said after ‘a fact’ in this song)

> Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice
> Post on TikTok videos? (I like the idea from @RoGarf that TikTok is a pun of time, but I think post could link to stamp, and therefore it may have something to do with timestamps)

> No need to spam or guess or stir things up (no need to find anagrams?)
> Just copy what this silly song shows (note: it’s what the song ‘shows’ not necessarily what it says)


My interpretation suggests that you need to tell someone ‘In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish’. This person is found elsewhere in the video (‘just use my VID to find out’) and I would think this person may give the 2nd clue. Joanna said the Goldfosh was buried so i doubt you need to claim it from someone.","",""

Libiamo, libiamo ne' lieti calici
che la bellezza infiora;
e la fuggevol, fuggevol ora
s'inebrii a voluttà.
Libiam ne' dolci fremiti
che suscita l'amore,
poiché quell'occhio al core onnipotente va.
Libiamo, amore, amor fra i calici
più caldi baci avrà.

Flora, Gastone, Barone, Dottore, Marchese, coro:
Ah, libiam, amor fra' calici

Tra voi, tra voi saprò dividere
il tempo mio giocondo;
tutto è follia, follia nel mondo
ciò che non è piacer.
Godiam, fugace e rapido
è il gaudio dell'amore;
è un fior che nasce e muore,
ne più si può goder.
Godiam, c'invita, c'invita un fervido
accento lusinghier.

Flora, Gastone, Barone, Dottore, Marchese, coro:
Ah, godiamo, la tazza, la tazza e il cantico,

in questo, in questo paradiso ne scopra il nuovo dì.

Violetta: La vita è nel tripudio.
Alfredo: Quando non s'ami ancora.
Violetta: Nol dite a chi l'ignora.

Let's drink, let's drink from the joyous chalices
that beauty blossoms.
And may the fleeting moment
be elated with voluptuousness.
Let's drink from the sweet thrills
that love arouses,
because that eye aims straight to the almighty heart.
Let's drink, my love: the love among chalices
will have warmer kisses.

Flora, Gastone, Barone, Dottore, Marchese, Chorus
Ah, let's drink, my love: the love among chalices

Violetta
With you, with you I'll be able to share
my cheerful times.
Everything is foolish in the world
which is not pleasure.
Let's enjoy ourselves, for fleeting and quick
the delight of love is:
it's a flower that blooms and dies
and can no longer be enjoyed.
Let's enjoy ourselves, fervent
flattering voice invites us.

Flora, Gastone, Barone, Dottore, Marchese, Chorus
Ah, let's enjoy the cup, the cup and the chants,
the embellished nights and the laughter;
let the new day find us in this paradise.

Violetta: Life means celebration.
Alfredo: If one hasn't known love.
Violetta: Don't tell someone who doesn't know.
Alfredo: But this is my fate.

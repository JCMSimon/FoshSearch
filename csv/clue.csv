""In the name of Max Fosh, dish out the fish""

That’s all you need to spout

Exactly who to ask and how?

Just use my vid to find out

To claim the precious trout

Neighbour on the bus or a dear old queen

With the possibility the world is packed

But the keeper of the secret is not close to Max

And that’s beyond a fact

Dance in a crazy way, use a squeaky voice

Post on TikTok videos?

No need to spam or guess or stir things up

Just copy what this silly song shows
```

^ This is the words he said _not_ including the (now we know) intentional typos. Difference being the subtitles contained an extra ""up"" before ""things"" on the 2nd-last line, and ""silly"" and ""song"" swapped on the last line.","","ShyCato (17),👀 (27),👏 (12),🇸 (16),🇺 (17),5️⃣ (15),🛒 (8),mou (13),londontothemax (12),🇬🇧 (11),Walt (3),catstare (3),catdead (6),ppOverheat (3),sadcat (3),thegrin (4),whitedot (2),👍 (3),❌ (3),🥶 (2)"

Well you’re after another clue aren’t you?
Hello! Hope you’ve been enjoying yourself while trying to find the fish.
The first thing, is the hundred-thousand dollar Goldfosh is still waiting for you to claim,
It hasn’t been found just yet so, keep on going.
And remember, it's in the name of Max Fosh. And that’s all you need to do, that’s all you need to say,
But to who? And how?
But one thing I want you to know is that you will know that you have found the keeper of the secret FOR SURE before you contact them.
And if there’s anything that I could add to the clue that came out about 6 weeks ago, it’d probably be this:
It’s important to note that there was a very helpful mistake in the transcription - a very melpful histake.
Happy hunting
